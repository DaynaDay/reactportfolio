    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Dayna Knight and I am writing regarding the Administrative Assistant within your company. Having
      discussed the job description, I believe my six years of customer service experience will make me a great addition
      to your office.
      I graduated from Drew University in 2015 with a degree in Anthropology and double minor in Archaeology and Studio
      Art. My degree directly correlates with encountering and interacting with various groups of people from different
      backgrounds and social settings which I believe will help in fostering understanding and relatability to possible
      clients.
